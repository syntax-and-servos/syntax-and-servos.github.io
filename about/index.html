    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Robotics has a software problem. Too much code is written to work once, on demo day, in good weather. We're three engineers who think that's not good enough. This blog is where we share actionable best practices, quick tips, and hard-won lessons on craftsmanship, architecture, culture, and leadership for software that lasts.</p>
<h2 id="marlin">Marlin</h2>
<p>Marlin has robotics experience across academia, government, and startups. He published, implemented, and field-tested motion planning algorithms that ran on diverse systems, from NASA's lightweight Mars Sample Return Helicopters to Gravis Robotics' powerful earth-moving machines. He co-maintains the Open Motion Planning Library and cares about writing maintainable software that works when it physically moves the hardware it runs on. This blog draws on what he's learned from taking algorithms from idea to field trial to business value.</p>
<h2 id="beni">Beni</h2>
<p>jada jada jada</p>
<h2 id="sandro">Sandro</h2>
<p>Sandro has over a decade of experience in software engineering at the intersection of software and hardware. Since 2008 he is writing software and since 2017 he is deploying autonomous robots into real-world, sometimes safety critical environments. Lately he pushes the boundaries of autonomous robots on construction sites at <a rel="external" href="https://gravisrobotics.com">Gravis Robotics</a>. He enjoys building the robust foundation that allows autonomous machines to operate reliably and he is especially passionate about teaching and advocating (pragmatic) best practices around software engineering.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about software craftsmanship, then don't hesitate to reach out to him!</p>
